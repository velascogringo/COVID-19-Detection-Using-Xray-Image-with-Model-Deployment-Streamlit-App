## About

This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for a COVID-19 detection application using X-ray images. The application is built using the Streamlit framework and allows users to upload X-ray images and receive predictions regarding whether the images contain signs of COVID-19 infection.

## Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of rapid and accurate diagnosis. X-ray images can be useful in detecting COVID-19 cases, and this repository provides a user-friendly application for this purpose. The Streamlit app allows users to interactively upload X-ray images and receive predictions from a trained machine learning model.

## Features

- Image Loading and Preprocessing
- Deep Learning Model Implementation (CNN)
- Model Deployment via Streamlit App

## Model
The model used for COVID-19 detection in this application is based on deep learning techniques and has been trained on a dataset of 2000 X-ray images. You can find more details about the model, including the architecture and training process, in the model directory.
